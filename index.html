        <h1>Downloading beta software!</h1>
        <p>You're about to download the BETA version of Ozon OS. This means that the OS will be incomplete and there will be bugs. We are not to be held responsible if using Ozon Beta results in you being teleported on an unknown island, on which you will have to become modern day Robinson Crusoe to survive.</p>

        <h1>What does Beta mean?</h1>
        <p>The term Beta in software means that a product is incomplete and needs further testing before becoming a stable product. Ozon Beta is exactly that - incomplete. You won't find much in the way of gaming optimisations, some apps and parts of the desktop experience might be missing, the artwork will be incomplete, and we don't recommend letting your cat browse the web just yet. However that doesn't mean the beta is not usable - it is stable and polished enough for fearless users, so feel free to give it a whirl at your own risk.</p>
